Welcome to my reading journal for Code Fellows. I am a new coding student, looking forward to discovering more about the tech industry. I'm looking forward to finding what most intrigues me in terms of developing my skills and where I can contribute those skills.

# **Growth Mindset**

>I see growth mindset as one's ability to say "I haven't got it quite yet, but maybe with the next try" rather than "I will never be able to do the thing." Here are three tips I keep in mind to help keep myself in a growth mindset mode:

- Have multiple mentors and/or resources to help get unstuck and moving forward again.
- Remind myself that we are all standing on the shoulders of those who came before us and reaching out for help is a given.
- Remind myself of a time that I was stuck; remember how I got unstuck, and/or how others helped me get unstuck; and recall how great it felt to get unstuck and grow. If I did it once, I can do it again!
