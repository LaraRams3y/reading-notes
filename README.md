>I see growth mindset as one's ability to say "I haven't got it quite yet, but maybe with the next try" rather than "I will never be able to do the thing." Here are three tips I keep in mind to help keep myself in a growth mindset mode:

- Have multiple mentors and/or resources to help get unstuck and moving forward again.
- Remind myself that we are all standing on the shoulders of those who came before us and reaching out for help is a given.
- Remind myself of a time that I was stuck; remember how I got unstuck, and/or how others helped me get unstuck; and recall how great it felt to get unstuck and grow. If I did it once, I can do it again!

## Notes on Markdown
### What Is Markdown?
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language, used to add formatting elements to plain text docs.
### Why Use Markdown?
>Markdown is a versatile language with great longevity. It is versatile in that it can be used across various applications and across various platforms. For this reason, it will also last beyond any singular app that may become obsolete.
