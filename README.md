# **Lara Ramsey Reading-Notes**
Welcome to my reading journal for Code Fellows. I am a new coding student, currently enrolled in Code-102 with Code Fellows. I am  looking forward to discovering more about the tech industry. Although on track to study software development, I am looking forward to discovering more about the various roles in the industry. I am curious to discover which roles suit skills interests and where I can contribute those the most.

This website is all about the new cool stuff I'm learning through Code Fellows. Find my GitHub profile and projects at [github.com/LaraRams3y](https://github.com/LaraRams3y)
