### HTML

**What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**
I've known for a while that the use of alt attributes can help with creating a more efficient SEO. If a person wants their site to get picked up by search engines, they can provide alt attributes with clear descriptions and key words that search engines will pick up and use to direct audiences toward the desired content. As well, alt text provides a description of images for folks who are using screen readers and can not see the images. This is yet another reason for providing clear and concise alt text.

**How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**
Provide an alt text description so that users can refer to it if they need to use the reader scanner or if the pathway to the image is broken. Also, specify width and heighth. Avoid title text as it is not reliable in conjunction with screen readers.

**Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**
When you would like to provide a container for your image, a figure element would be useful. In particular, it would be useful for the inclusion of the figure caption element which provides you with the ability to include text beneath your image, like a title, but a better approach than a title.

**Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.** 

"GIF" stands for graphics interchange format. gifs are good for standard projects. GIFs will give you good quality, but can distort or lose quality as they shrink or expand.

"SVG" stands for scalable vector graphics. This file type expands and shrinks, but maintains its quality at whatever size you expand or shrink it to. SVG is desired for projects where you want your image to remain crystal clear at whatever small or large size the user expands or shrinks it to... whatever screen type they will be viewing from... whatever graphic project the image is being used for.

**What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**
JPEG or PNG seem to me to be fine. A screenshot is a pretty simple image. It wouldn't need vector status to provide viewers with what they need.

### CSS

**Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.Background color fills in the color behind the content within the particular box that you are working. The foreground color colors everything that is not the background. Typically this is text. 

**Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character? I'd say sure! And then I'd give his blog an interesting wallpaper as the very back. Then I'd give the usual background a cool purple-blue shade. I would adjust text to white as needed against the purple background.

**What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
One thing to consider is if it is "web safe". 
Consider using a font family so most likely the browser will respond to one of the fonts you've chosen.

**What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements? Font-size changes the size of the font chosen. Font-weight helps you choose a thickness of the lettering; it sets how bold your tet is. Font style helps you turn italic text on or off.

**Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element. Work with the Text Layout Styles. You could work with a font that holds space as part of its look.

Not much. I'm just excited to get back into the essay and work on applying these concepts.
