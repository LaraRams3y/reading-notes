>I see growth mindset as one's ability to say "I haven't got it quite yet, but maybe with the next try" rather than "I will never be able to do the thing." 

Completing this program will be quite a challenge. I will be continuing to work, raise two children, run a household, and maintain a marriage. At times it seems like these things will all flow together to support this journey; most of the time I am frustrated by how each things presents additional challenges to an already challenging program. Here are some growth mindset tips I will try to keep in mind to help keep myself on track:

- Have multiple mentors and/or resources.
- Remind myself that it's okay to ask for help. We are all standing on the shoulders of those who came before us and reaching out for help is a given.
- Recall a time that I was stuck; remember how I got unstuck. If I did it once, I can do it again!
- Create achievable goals and acknowledge those achievements once I reach them.
- Keep my longterms goals constantly in mind: double or tiple my current income, a career field with multiple options and variations in employment opportunities, a career field with a projected 25% growth for the next decade, a property with horses... or a dream property and the ability to pursue horse riding.
